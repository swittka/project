\section*{Abstract}
One of the essential objectives of functional verification is to reuse verification code when moving from one verification level to a higher one. Therefore lower level components have to be integrated into a hierarchy with other components. This cannot be done without further ado, if the components are implemented in different verification languages. So fully operative code would have to be rewritten from scratch. This time consuming approach can be avoided by using the open source \emph{Universal Verification Methodology Multi-Language} package provided by Accellera. It allows the reuse of verification components of different languages to build a fully operative multi-languages testbench. This paper shows how to use this package to reuse UVM-SystemVerilog components in UVM-\textit{e} ones and vice versa, especially how to build a multi-language testbench, configure it and establish communication between the components. Furthermore it is demonstrated how to execute sequences and sequence items of foreign components. Eventually it is evaluated, which parts of the package have to be improved to ensure building a multi-language testbench with less effort. Particularly implementing an integrated end of test synchronization as well as a less effortful method of reusing foreign sequences.
